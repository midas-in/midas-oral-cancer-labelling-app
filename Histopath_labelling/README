Histopathology Image Labelling Tool

An executable clinical-grade GUI tool for expert annotation of histopathology images with structured diagnosis and multi-tier grading, designed for OSCC and precancer research pipelines.

This version enforces correct pathological logic:

Ungradable is a grading state (not a primary diagnosis)

Indeterminate is a primary diagnosis with mandatory comment

Dysplasia: Binary + Three-Tier OR Ungradable

Cancer: Three-Tier Differentiation OR Ungradable

Normal: Tissue type (Stroma / Epithelium / Both)

Key Features
Pathology-Correct Grading Logic
Primary Diagnosis	Secondary Rules

Dysplasia	Binary (Low/High Risk) + Three-Tier (Mild/Moderate/Severe) OR Ungradable
Cancer	Three-Tier Differentiation (Well/Moderate/Poor) OR Ungradable
Indeterminate	Mandatory free-text reason
